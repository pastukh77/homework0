## What does our program do?

The system of estimation of parameters of a roof will allow the user to count the prospects of the location. Using the information on the average insolation and wind speed in a particular region and roof square, the program will provide the user with quantitative advice on the prospects of introducing this system of ventilation and heating of the room on his roof.

The result of the project was this web application: <>. Using which, the user with the help of three stages gets the information he needs.

### What information does the user provide and receive?

The user must provide the following information:
- choose on the map of Ukraine the region in which his house is located;
- select the period for which the statistics interest him
- indicate the area of the roof facing south;
- on the diagram select the coefficient that depends on the angle of rotation to the south and the angle of the roof.

This program will provide the user with the following information (for the selected period):
- quantitative characteristics of solar energy that could be concentrated on its roof;
- information on the average wind speed;
- comparative aspects of the regions of Ukraine about the prospects of such a system;
- graphs of average wind speed in the regions of Ukraine.
